## Installation

3. When the command execution is complete and there are no errors, you will see the dist folder in the project root directory, which is the application after publishing. You can copy it to run anywhere. In windows, you can directly click to run the dist folder Blogifier.exe , in linux, please authorize the executable permission of the Blogifier binary file first and then click or run it on the command line. [note] Because the app_data directory does not exist in the release, an error may occur when the program starts. Just start it again.

3. Done, enjoy.

## Contributing

The current Blogifier is not perfect enough, blog software pursues perfect functions and easy to use, maybe [wordpress](https://wordpress.org) is more suitable, relatively speaking, this project still lacks many functions. The latest version has not been released yet, and the current project is more suitable for developers to build and use by themselves. We can work together Improvement, implement a blog system completely implemented by dotnet technology. Faster, simpler, and smaller.

You can first propose functions in issues and develop them in pull requests, so that you can track the development progress. Everyone is welcome to participate in the development together. Let's learn and explore the latest technology of dotnet together.
